# LoL Ping
Just a small non-fancy batch script to check your ping for the game League of Legends so you can determine if you will be able to play without lagging. Just remember, if your teamates feed, dont flame them...ts probably lag ;)

All you have to do is run the .exe file to get started. You can copy/paste it to your desired location if you wish. 

Servers used and their IP's:

1. NA: 104.160.131.3
2. EUW: 104.160.141.3
3. EUNE: 104.160.142.3
4. OCE: 104.160.156.1
5. LAN: 104.160.136.3

It is important to note that he League servers have ICMP protection on so the pings displayed may be a little higher than what they will actually be in game and may packet loss. Its only the ICMP protection.
