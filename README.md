# LoL Ping
A batch script to check your in game ping for the game "League of Legends" so you can determine if you will be able to play without lagging before the game starts. 

Run the .exe or .bat file to get started. You can copy/paste it to your desired location if you wish. 

Servers used and their IP's:

1. NA: 104.160.131.3
2. EUW: 104.160.141.3
3. EUNE: 104.160.142.3
4. OCE: 104.160.156.1
5. LAN: 104.160.136.3

It is important to note that the League servers have ICMP protection on so the pings displayed may be a little higher than what they will actually be in game and may packet loss. Its only the ICMP protection.
